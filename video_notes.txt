Introduce myself and project
  - uvic csc 462 distributed systems
  - had the head of a naval architecture firm come into class and explain a problem that they are looking to solve which at its core is just going to be a massive database

Tools used
  - mongodb (talk about relational vs non-relational)
  - docker and specifically docker swarm
  - AWS (arbitrary decision for cloud hosting)
  - web app run on nodejs with express

Show diagrams
  - mongodb doc diagram (briefly mention the control flow between components)
  - diagram showing different services and shards (mention the redundancy and replication to achieve availability and fault tolerance)
  - diagram showing service placement on the different aws isntances

Demo
  - short cut of aws instances spun up in aws ui
  - short cuts of docker swarm init and 1 join
  - short cut of ./startCluster.sh
  - short cut of ./addShard.sh
  - short cut of python script issuing writes to the api
  - db.parts.count() to show all the writes were successful
  - sh.status() to show the data spread out across the shards
